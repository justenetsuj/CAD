Parametric Enclosures
=====================

Several parametric enclosures I designed.

Partially to end up with some nice reusable enclosure designs, mainly to get to know OpenSCAD better.

When enclosures have been generated the DXFs can be modified to include whatever mounting holes, etc are needed.

Building
--------

To build the entire set of DXFs for an enclosure: ```make``` or a single part with ```make [part]```, parts are listed in the readme for each enclosure.

DXFs can be removed using ```make clean```.

Configuration
-------------

Design configuration is done in an enclosure's ```config.scad``` which contains documentation on the function of each option.
