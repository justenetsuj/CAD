"Laptop Style" Tablet Stand
===========================

A stand allowing a tablet to be used with keyboard in a similar configuration to a laptop.

The two panels are designed to be held together using three lengths of 4mm threaded bar with appropriate spacing between the panels (e.g. using aluminium tubing cut to the correct length).

This is designed for a keyboard 5mm thick (Motorola Xoom Bluetooth keyboard) and a tablet no thicker than 10mm (most modern tablets should fit this requirement) and no taller than 185mm when in landscape orientation but could be adapted for other devices, the width of the keyboard and tablet can be compensated for by altering the spacing between each side panel.
