CAD
===

Various CAD drawings for off the shelf parts.  
Mostly DXF and KiCAD files for common parts I use which may be of use to others.  
Note that not all dimensions are guaranteed to be accurate, always double check before manufacture.  
Pin labels usually list special functions first and disregard generic functions (e.g. RasPi pin 3 is labelled as SDA, not GPIO 0/2).

RaspberryPi main board was adapted from DXF found [here](http://www.raspberry-projects.com/pi/pi-hardware/model-b-cad).
